I am a full-time front-end engineer currently working at Wix.com as a solution engineer and advocate. I also have a business in Japan, a web service I created. (https://labelmake.jp/).
Currently, I am based in Tokyo, Japan, but I would like to work in another country if I get the chance someday.

Please feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn. I am always happy to talk, answer questions, or discuss new opportunities.
