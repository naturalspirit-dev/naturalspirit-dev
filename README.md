I am a design-minded front-end developer && blockchain focused on building exceptional digital experiences, highly versatile and driven by learning. When problems arise, I seek ways to fix them. Whether it takes reading a book or picking up a lesson in a new framework, Iâ€™ve always been eager to solve the challenges that development can bring. Also I am working on Blockchain technology as well like EthereumSmart Contract, Layer 2 solutions. I am a fast learner so I can work with any unfamiliar programming.
